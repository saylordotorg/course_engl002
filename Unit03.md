**Unit 3: Reviewing and Analyzing Your Sources** <span id="3"></span> 
*A successful research paper is more than a well-constructed argument
supplemented by facts, figures, and quotations. Like the good writing
that it supports, successful research involves planning, careful
analysis, and reflection. Before you can incorporate an outside source
into your work, you must take some time to think about more than just
the facts and ideas that you have uncovered. Is the source
authoritative? Is the information substantiated fact, or is it primarily
opinion? Is it up-to-date? Is it accurate and complete? These are just
some of the essential questions you must ask about each piece of source
information that you discover.*

*In this unit, you will take an in-depth look at some techniques for
analyzing and evaluating the information that you locate. As you review
critical reading as a research strategy, you will look very closely at
techniques for evaluating and comparing information that you find on the
Internet and in print. You will learn some well-established techniques
for determining whether a source is reputable and authoritative, and you
will acquire some tools for discerning fact and opinion. You will also
get to have a little fun as you complete a WebQuest in which you will
find and analyze information online.  
  
 By the time you have completed this unit, you should be more confident
about how and when to use the sources you have identified, and you
should have a basic understanding of how to use your research to
effectively and clearly support a well-developed academic paper. You
will also be ready to complete your research.*
