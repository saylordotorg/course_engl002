**Unit 4: Putting Your Source Material to Work** <span id="4"></span> 
*Many college research papers are structured primarily as arguments that
are supported, at least in part, by evidence gathered from outside
sources. A major purpose of the Composition I course was to define
written arguments and to practice some techniques for developing
them. To help clarify the close relationships between research and
argumentation, we will use the first part of this unit to review some of
the basics of formulating written arguments. As we do so, you will be
able to explore the best techniques for putting research to work in your
writing, and we will analyze how these techniques support the
fundamental requirements of successful academic writing.  
    
 As we discuss the essential components, you should pay particular
attention to how your research must support your basic logical structure
and rhetorical strategy. This unit will give you a chance to get a
little more practice in analyzing and developing written arguments.  
    
 You will spend some time investigating how various forms of research
can support different writing strategies, including literary analysis,
discussions, and comparison-contrast strategies. You will get some more
practice in using research and analytical tools, and you will have an
opportunity to update your paper if you think it needs it.  
    
 Before we begin the more rigorous practice of citation and style in
Unit 4, we will take a more general look at how to build quotations,
paraphrases, and summaries into your work. You will be able to explore
the best uses for all of these forms of reference so that you can use
your source material confidently without changing its meaning, tone, or
intent – or distorting your own.  
    
 At the end of the unit, you will use what you have learned to create a
detailed outline that specifies what resources you will use where and
develop your arguments more fully.*

**4.4.2 Revising Your Outline** <span id="4.4.2"></span>

    Instructions: Return to your outline and flesh out as much detail as
    possible. Your thesis should be clear and focused, and all of your
    logic and evidence should clearly support that controlling idea.
    Using your annotated bibliography, make note of the sources you will
    use to support your arguments. You may identify points that could
    use additional clarification and notice a few small holes in your
    research, though your information-gathering should be almost
    complete at this point. If needed, conduct some more research to
    fill these gaps  
      
     Completing this activity should take 2 hours.
