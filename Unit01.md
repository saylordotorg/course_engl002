**Unit 1: Research and the Writing Process** <span id="1"></span> 
*Researching and reporting the results of research are fundamental to
academic work in almost every discipline, as well as in many
professional contexts. While research in itself may seem like an
enormous task when you are just starting a project, it is important to
understand that effective research is a straightforward, step-by-step
process. By practicing effective research techniques and becoming adept
with the tools that are available to researchers, you will begin to see
research as an invaluable part of an organized system of study that
includes discovery, invention, critical thinking, and clear
communication.  
  
 While writing is sometimes viewed as a solitary undertaking, research
requires active involvement in a larger community of scholars. You will
have a chance to define yourself as a member of a number of communities,
and you will begin to see your research as an important part of the
conversations that take part among members of your communities. As you
begin to see yourself as an active contributor in a community, you will
start to understand how the work of others can both enrich your own
perceptions and improve your understanding of the topic about which you
are writing.  
  
 To help you get started as a contributing member of a community of
scholars, we will first explore how your research can support the
writing process that you began to develop in Composition I. You will
recall that the PWR Method is a process based on pre-writing, writing,
editing, and proofreading, so it is probably no surprise to learn that
effective research follows a similar process and is based on similar
methods of preparation and analysis.  
  
 By mastering the essentials of effective research, you can train
yourself to think more carefully about your work at every stage of the
writing process. For example, you probably know how much a good quote
can help to emphasize an important point, but you may not be conscious
of how helpful general background research can be in the very earliest
phases of your writing, when you are just beginning to refine your topic
and clarify your thesis and argument.  
  
 As we continue to build your experience as a member of a research
community, we will explore how effective research can help you appeal to
specific audiences and more clearly define the purpose of your writing.*
