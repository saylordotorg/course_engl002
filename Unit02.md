**Unit 2: Researching: How, What, When, Where, and Why** <span
id="2"></span> 
*If you are already at work on a writing project, you most likely are
well aware that you often need to start writing in order to discover all
of your ideas about a subject. In this unit, we will take the discovery
process a bit further by exploring how identifying, analyzing, and
making effective use of the work of others can do even more to clarify
your viewpoint and refine your thesis.  
  
 We will begin by looking at research as a concept. By now, you should
feel a little more comfortable thinking of yourself as a researcher and
you may be anxious to get started. To get you off on the right foot, we
will look at how analysis and planning can streamline your research
efforts and help you to make the best use of your findings. After that,
we will dig deeply into the research process itself. In addition to
learning more about traditional library research methods, you will have
a chance to get acquainted with methods for conducting research in
person, on your own computer, and on the Internet.  
  
 We will also define primary and secondary sources and will look at some
of the merits of using both of these types of information. We will spend
quite a bit of time reviewing the tools and techniques for conducting
research on the Internet. You will have a chance to explore some of the
most useful Internet sites for locating both printed and online
information, and you will start to get a clearer idea about where to
look for information in specific disciplines and to fulfill specific
purposes.*

*Finally, we will acknowledge the importance of keeping research
well-organized and clearly documented. You will get a chance to practice
the best techniques for recording, organizing, and annotating the source
information that you want to use.  
  
 By the end of this unit, you should have a good understanding of how to
carry out your research in an organized, thoughtful manner. You should
also have the opportunity to complete much of the preliminary research
for your final paper and to identify any information gaps that may
require further investigation.*

**2.1 Recording and Organizing Your Findings** <span id="2.1"></span> 
*Before we will discuss the details of the research process, we will
explore some note-taking tools and strategies, so you can begin taking
organized notes from the outset of your research.*

**2.1.1 Note-Taking Tools** <span id="2.1.1"></span> 
*Later in this unit, you will learn about several tools to help you

     Instructions: Watch this brief video on reverse outlining. Take
    notes so that you remember the technique while you are reviewing and
    taking notes on your research articles. Then, practice writing a
    reverse outline of one of the resources you plan to use in your
    research paper.  
      
     Watching this video and creating a reverse outline for practice
    should take approximately 15 minutes.
